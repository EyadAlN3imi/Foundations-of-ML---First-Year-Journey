# Foundations-of-ML---First-Year-Journey

Known Issues
The code in this repository was developed during my first year at university and has several areas that could be improved:

Hardcoded parameters instead of making them configurable.
Lack of proper documentation for some functions.
No error handling or exception management.
Inefficient code leading to longer execution times.
No modularization, with all logic combined in single scripts.
Overfitting issues due to missing regularization techniques.
Inconsistent naming conventions, making the code harder to read.
No testing framework to validate the models.
These issues are recognized, and improvements will be made in future updates.
